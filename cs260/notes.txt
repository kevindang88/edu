Can't use functions in csh, the only upside is that I can just manipulate the 
values of SAVINGS and CHECKING instead of passing them around as parameters.
I could try to write multiple scripts and have the main script call them
like functions, but passing variables and returning them is extremely
inelegant.

I can basically treat ksh and bash like procedural programming
languages. Encapsulate everything in functions.

Aliases in csh don't update their variable values???
Values are the same as they were when the alias was set.

csh - Huge switch cases because of lack of functions
